TestNG/Junit - traditional way of writing our test script 
Test Next generation - 

Why using a testing library? 

1. execution is happening line by line - we don't have 
any control over code execution 
pre-requirement 
2. creating pass/fail scnerio - 
expected result - from the requirement 
actual result - from the test 
compare expected and actual
are same >> test passes
not same >> test fails 

3. generate any test report - 

4. test suite - 500 tests - collection of test scripts 

5. data driven framework - 

6. dependecnies, priority, enable,
