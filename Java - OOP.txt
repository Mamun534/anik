how Java works? 

What is OOP - Object oriendted Programming? 

creating class to define two thins >> 
prototype or design >> 
system: 
what the system/class can do>> function/methods
what are the attributes of the system/class>>  properties

you make a design of a car - doors, engines, wheels, windsheild

100 - object 

OOP 
design a system - methods, properties 
object of the system - method, properties 
class - functions, properties
object  - whatever class it is coming 

constructor overloading - mulitple constructor  with different 
parameters - 

static - is not related with object, only stays in the class
to call them we just need to use the class

method overloading: same function name with different parameters

accessibility of the functions or properties 

access modifier >> public, private, protected, no-modifer 

protected - can only be accessed from the class and the same
pacakge 

private - can be accesses only from the same class - not even
from the same package 

public - accessed from the same class, same pacakge and different
pacakge 

no modifer - protected
