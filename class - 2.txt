Java Programming - class - 1 

java, python, c, c++ , C# 

compiler/interpreter - jdk - java compiler

int x = 23; 
x=87;

1. data - storing data
2. condition 

Syntax of the code is different >> 
number, name, decimal number 
datatype 

int x = 12; 

datatype variable = data; 

int x = 12; 
String name = "michael";
float y = 10.9; 
boolean flag = true; 

two steps to store data 

declaretion; 

int abcd; 

String firstName;


intialize 

abcd = 34; 


String name = "jon"; 

String is the data type
name is the variable name 
jon is the variable value 

int num = 45; 

int is the data type
num is the name of the variable
45 is the value of the variable 

Key Point 1: java is a case sensitive language 

int 
Int 
String 
string 

int Abcd; 

How to store a data in java, 

datatype variable = value; 

int x; 
x=67; 

1. create a java project 
2. basic unit of any java code is a java class 
3. code executes from the main method 


class, methods, controls statements scope 

{}

int 
String 
boolean 

packages are java folder 

boolean 

true/false


1. learning how to create java project, package, and class
2. how to create a class with main method of java 
3. different datatypes in java 
int, String, boolean

double 

operation >> sum, subtraction, 
System.out.println

4. conditional statement - control statement 

if we want to execute some codes based on the condition, 
we use conditional statement 

if(condition) {

// code is here

}

equal to something
greater or less than something
combination of these 

assignment 

x=100

x==100

Problem: 

car dealership needs a software to calculate the montly payment
for customer 

solution: 

data we need: 

carprice 
interest rate >>> credit scroe 
how many installment - how many years you want to pay
downpayment 
taxes 
trade - in 

monthy payment = total car price/number of months 
12000 - 2000 = 10000

10000 X (1.5/100)>> 150 + 10000 >> 10150
