Class - 3 Java 

what is the basic unit of java code? 

java package - java folder 

java class - Test script 

main method >> starting point of java code 


class >> variables are only inside the class 

int x; 

int x; 


10400 eaton place, fairfax, VA 

10400 eaton place, arlington, VA

why we use conditional statement? 

when we want to execute code based on some conditions 


if I have money(true/false) I am going to buy a car

if(creditscore>700){
apr = 1; 
}

if(creditscore<700 and crediscorte>650){
apr=2; 
}



if(condition) {

// code 

}

= assinging a value
== comparing two values

else will not get executed if, the condition is true 

if you have money you will buy a car 
if you have time you will go to walmart

called 
2. a function is created to use the same code again and again

we need to find a web-element

function is set of instructions get exectued upon called 

procedural programming - main method
OOP - 

public int addnumbers(double a){

int x;

}

public in subtractnumbers(){

int x; 

}



local variable - variables those are created inside a function
main method/regular method
2. how to use the function that we created 

creating an object of the class 

classname objecment = new classname(); 

running a function is only from a runanble class

3. how to use the functions created by other programmers in different
libraries 

selenium, TestNg, cucumber

jdk >> java development kit 

java core library + java runtime enviroment (jre) 

gettext

sendkeys

why we are using void? 

sendkeys("sgafgsa");
